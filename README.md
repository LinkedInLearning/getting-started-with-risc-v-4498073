RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that allows for a new era of processor innovation through collaboration and shared technical investment. Combining a fast foundation architecture with a modular approach to design, chipmakers, hobbyists, and users alike find it easy to work with this incredibly flexible yet manageable system.

This course provides an overview of the core concepts, community, ecosystem, philosophy, and architectural principles to help you get started with RISC-V. Join instructor Eduardo Corpeño as he offers insights on using multiplication and division, floating-point operations, and other ISA extensions. Be sure to check out the demos and simulation examples at the end of the course to get a better understanding of how RISC-V can be used in real-world applications.
